# ðŸ’° Fees

Mango Markets charges fees on various markets and operations. All fees are voted on by the DAO and accrue to a DAO controlled wallet (FrkLPsCadx4tE4qDobbu2GTD5ffjWBpormHbLLy35PUS) which can be seen via governance: [https://dao.mango.markets/dao/MNGO/treasury/v2] (https://dao.mango.markets/dao/MNGO/treasury/v2).

### Market Based Fees
* **Openbook** - Maker/taker fees are -0.02%/0.04%. Since Mango is integrated with Openbook the DAO only receives a fraction of what Openbook collects via referrer fees
* **Mango Swaps** - Swap fees are 0.1%, with a fee of 0.2% for stop-loss/take-profit orders
* **Mango Perps** - Maker/taker fees are -0.03%/0.1%. Stop-loss orders have a fee of 0.2% 

### Token Based Fees
While market fees are the same across all markets, there are some fees that vary in amount based on the token. Typically liquidity is the largest factor in determining fee amount.
* Loans have an origination fee of 0.05%-0.2% and a fee of 0.5% on interest accrued 
* Liquidations have fees ranging from 5-20%
