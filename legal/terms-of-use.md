2\. Non-Custodial Nature of Mango Markets and the Website

The Foundation does not facilitate or provide brokerage, exchange, payment, escrow, remittance or merchant services. The Foundation is not a broker/dealer or a provider of securities services, and is not registered with the SEC or similar securities regulators in other jurisdictions. The Foundation is not a depository institution and is not registered with or insured by any governmental agency. Your tokens are stored in a digital wallet you control, and over which The Foundation exercises no control. Though multiple wallets are supported, The Foundation does not recommend any particular wallet. The onus is on the user to select an appropriate wallet to utilize in connection with Mango Markets, and to take all proper steps to ensure the security and integrity of said wallet.

Mango Markets is open source, built upon the Solana blockchain and Serum DEX protocol. Mango Markets utilizes a permissionless system, meaning that user activity is not subject to review or approval by The Foundation, nor are assets screened before listing or subject to removal. The Foundation makes no representations as to the liability or prudence of using third party services and is not responsible for any technical shortcomings of third-party programs, errors arising from user installation or configuration, or other security vulnerabilities caused by software deployments or hardware environments controlled or configured by the user. Any information provided by the Foundation are offered as-is, with no representation that they are free from technical error. Users making use of the Website do so at their own risk, and are advised to proceed with caution.

In connection with your use of the Website, you are required to pay all fees necessary for interacting with certain blockchain networks, including, without limitation, the Solana blockchain. Such fees may include “gas” costs, as well as all other fees reflected Website at the time of your activity, including trading fees and network access fees. The Foundation cannot assist in the recovery of fees from transactions you execute improperly, and/or any fees paid to third parties for the use of resources said parties supply to the blockchain.&#x20;



3\. Disclaimer

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, THE FOUNDATION DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL PROMISES, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DATA ACCURACY, SYSTEM INTEGRATION, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND/OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WEBSITE PROVIDED BY THE FOUNDATION ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED HEREIN, YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL DISCLAIMERS OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING IN THIS SECTION AND ELSEWHERE IN THESE TERMS OF USE) ARE MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF BOTH THE FOUNDATION AND ITS AFFILIATES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, AND REPRESENTATIVES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF USE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE NOT RELIED UPON ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF THE FOUNDATION OR ITS AFFILIATES, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS OF USE.

While the Foundation will try to maintain the timeliness, integrity, and security of the Website, you understand that we cannot and do not guarantee or warrant that the Website, and any files available for downloading from the Site will be free of viruses or other destructive code. You are responsible for implementing sufficient procedures and checkpoints to satisfy your particular requirements for anti-virus protection and accuracy of data input and output, and for maintaining a means external to our site for any reconstruction of any lost data.



4\. Risk of Digital Assets and Decentralized Networks

Please note that all transactions involving digital assets involve risks. You should therefore carefully consider whether using the Website is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to hold digital assets, you should be aware that the price or value of digital assets can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. Past performance is not an indicator of future performance. By utilizing the Website, you acknowledge that you are able to incur a complete loss of monies or amounts paid without impairing your financial condition, and you are able to bear the entire economic risk of using the Website for an indefinite period of time.

We are not responsible for any digital asset market and we make no representations or warranties concerning the real or perceived value of digital assets as denominated in any quoted currency. Although we may provide historical and/or real-time data regarding the price of digital assets, we make no representations regarding the quality, suitability, truth, usefulness, accuracy, or completeness of such data, and you should not rely on such data for any reason whatsoever. You understand and agree that the value of digital assets can be volatile, and we are not in any way responsible or liable for any losses you may incur by using or transferring digital assets in connection with the Website. Digital assets which may be referenced on the Website have not been reviewed by The Foundation, and The Foundation makes no representation as to the quality, safety, legality, or any other aspect of any digital assets that you may transfer to or from a third party. You acknowledge that The Foundation, through the Website is not offering or executing exchange services but is merely providing a digital interface through which you can engage with the blockchain directly to exchange assets at your sole discretion and of your own accord, subject to other limitations stipulated within these Terms of Use.

You acknowledge that it is your duty to ensure correct information is inputted for any and all trades you initiate which you directly execute on the blockchain. At no point does The Foundation take custody of digital assets being traded, and consequently The Foundation is unable to assist in digital asset retrieval caused by user error. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any loss of your digital asset resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of digital asset private keys outside our control. You must take sufficient steps to safeguard seed phrases, private keys, 2FA devices, and all other user-controlled assets that are vulnerable to hacking or theft.
