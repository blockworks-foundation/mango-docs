Note that these are simply guidelines for the severity of the bugs. Each bug bounty submission will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

#### Submission <a href="#iq-submission" id="iq-submission"></a>

Please email [security@mango.markets](mailto:security@mango.markets) with a detailed description of the attack vector. For critical and moderate bugs, we require a proof of concept done on a privately deployed mainnet contract. We will reach out in 1 business day with additional questions or next steps on the bug bounty.

#### Bug Bounty Payment <a href="#zj-bug-bounty-payment" id="zj-bug-bounty-payment"></a>

Bug bounties will be paid in USDC or locked MNGO, after a DAO vote. The Mango DAO has never refused a bug bounty so far.

#### Invalid Bug Bounties <a href="#i-invalid-bug-bounties" id="i-invalid-bug-bounties"></a>

The following are out of scope for the bug bounty:

* Attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage.
* Attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials.
* Attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, admin).
* Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles (this does not exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks).
* Lack of liquidity.
* Third party, off-chain bot errors (for instance bugs with an arbitrage bot running on the smart contracts).
* Best practice critiques.
* Sybil attacks.
